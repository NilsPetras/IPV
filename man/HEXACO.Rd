\description{
Cleaned-up data from an ad-hoc online sample of n = 22786 participants on the
240 items of the IPIP HEXACO Equivalent Scales. Data were collected before
21st June 2014 within the Open-Source Psychometrics Project
(\url{https://openpsychometrics.org/}). After including only those
participants who did at least "agree" on the items "I understand the
instructions for this test." and "I have answered all of these questions as
accurately as possible.", data on n = 20365 participants remains.
